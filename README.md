# 🎯 Coreball Game

**Coreball** is an addictive and fast-paced arcade game that tests your timing and precision. Inspired by the classic console game from the early 2010s, Coreball challenges players to throw balls onto a spinning core without colliding with other balls already stuck to it. As levels progress, the difficulty increases with changing speeds, rotating directions, and more complex ball arrangements.
